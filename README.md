# PSYC 5500: Electroencephalography

### This repository contains Python code I translated from MATLAB incorporating select chapters of Mike Cohen's "Analyzing Neural Time Series Data" 

#### University of Virginia, Spring 2020

- If you have trouble viewing the notebooks (as is often the case on GitHub), you can copy and paste the link of the notebooks to view them here: https://nbviewer.org/. Most of the code is figure and equation driven so it simply wouldn't be the same if they were written as .py files.

- The translated code is contained within the notebooks folder, along with the associated sample EEG data.
